For DanHalbert, the road to 
Tycho began in collegeâ€”when 
Lissa Lenz asked to borrow his 
computer. Hers had broken down,
 and unless she could borrow 
another, she would fail her 
midterm project. 
There was no 
one she dared ask, except Dan.


This put Dan in a dilemma. He 
had to help herâ€”but if he 
lent her his computer, she 
might read his books. Aside 
from the fact that you could go
 to prison for many years for 
letting someone else read your 
books, the very idea shocked 
him at first.
 Like everyone, 
he had been taught since 
elementary school that sharing 
books was nasty and wrongâ€
